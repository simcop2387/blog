I'm getting ready to reorganize/restructure the units in Farnsworth
so that they can all be documented (and make it so that ancient
units and things can be easily excluded/included in a script).
While I'm doing this I want to be able to make some nice
documentation and make an official way to include and document code
written in the language. To that end I'm getting ready to start
extending
[doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ "doxygen") so that
it can be used to document all the code written in Farnsworth can
have documentation included fairly easily. I'd also love any
comments and suggestions for other systems if someone knows one
that's better; the only other one I'm very familiar with is
[POD](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html "POD") and that would be
a real pain in the ass to get into the parser to handle things
correctly.
