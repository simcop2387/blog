Thanks to a
[friend of mine](http://symkat.com/105/cookieless-domains/) I've
now got something like a
[CDN](http://symkat.com/118/introducing-sympullcdn/) setup to help
accelerate the site no matter where I end up hosting it. This means
that the site should go quite a bit faster than it used to and It's
given me a reason to actually learn
[Python](http://www.python.org/). This has given me a few ideas for
possible syntax and features that might be useful for both the
module system and other things for the language.
