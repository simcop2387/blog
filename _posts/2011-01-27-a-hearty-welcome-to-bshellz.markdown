There's been a request to me to bring the bot into \#bshellz for
helping with users that don't speak english very well. So i'm
writing up a small tutorial for them on how to use the translation
api in Farnsworth. Here is a list of languages currently supported.
Any more that google adds to it's translation service I will add as
I get time.
    Arabic  Bulgarian  Catalan  Czech  Danish  German
    Greek  English  Spanish  Estonian  Finnish  French  Galician
    Hindi  Croatian  Hungarian  Indonesian  Italian Hebrew
    Japanese  Korean  Lithuanian  Latvian  Maltese  Dutch
    Norwegian  Polish  Portuguese  Romanian  Russian
    Slovak  Slovenian  Albanian  Serbian  Swedish  Thai
    Filipino  Turkish  Ukrainian  Vietnamese  Chinese  Chinese_Traditional

How you use these is like this.
    <you> farnsworth: "I do not speak your language" -> Spanish
    <farnsworth> you: "Yo NOTY hablan su idioma"

Now this is all very well and good if you know what language they
are speaking, but what if you don't?
    <you> farnsworth: "Jinsi gani mimi kupata shell yako na kukimbia exploits mizizi juu yake" -> DetectLanguage
    <farnsworth> you:  "Swahili"
    <you> farnsworth: "Jinsi gani mimi kupata shell yako na kukimbia exploits mizizi juu yake" -> English
    <farnsworth> you:  "How do I get your shell to run exploits on his roots"

Now there are also other features on the bot, math related that you
can explore here on the rest of my site.
