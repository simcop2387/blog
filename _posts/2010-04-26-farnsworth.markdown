Ok, now that I've got things setup here I plan on using this place
for keeping track of what's going on in the Farnsworth community
(i.e. me, there's only me right now). I'll be making official
announcements and posts about the current state of what I'm working
on in the interpreter. (since this is also a personal page for
myself i'll also eventually have a copy of my resume and everything
else here but that'll come a bit later), here's hoping that things
turn out well.
