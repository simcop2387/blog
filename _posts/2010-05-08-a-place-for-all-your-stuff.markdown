Okay, I'm anticipating a few users coming here that may have
written neat little functions and things in Farnsworth. And I'd
love for you guys to show off the snippets you've written. I'm
going to do another article here in a bit about some changes I made
last night to the latest WIP version of Farnsworth that let you do
neat things with lambdas and unit conversions that'll let more
things work in as natural a fashion as possible. So come show off
your snippets!
