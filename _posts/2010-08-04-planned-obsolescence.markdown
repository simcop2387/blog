I've decided that i'm going to be removing the `unit[]` "function"
since its using a different part of the api that I don't like
anymore. I also suspect that none of you are using it (who are you
guys anyway?). I'll be replacing it with an operator instead since
that's really what it was. I don't know if i'll keep that operator
around forever or not but it will most certainly be with more
notice and more thought about removing it. Let the complaints
begin, (pretty please? someone? is there anyone out there?)
