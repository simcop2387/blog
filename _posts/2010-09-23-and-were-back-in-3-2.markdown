Ok i've been struggling with my webhost for a while now, it was
free but the service was getting horrible and I think they've gone
down for the count. As such i'm now hosting it elsewhere and we'll
hope this one is more stable (though i do know they don't have very
much backup power but it shouldn't be a problem).
