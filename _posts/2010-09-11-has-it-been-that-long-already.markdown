As of today, it's been two years since the first commit I made to
start this project. It started out as an open source clone of
another program so that people (mostly me) could use it for doing
some math on IRC and have all kinds of fun figuring out how many
farts it would take to power a laptop. Since then the project has
grown wildly out of control and I couldn't be happier about it.
It's still not even close to anything that I'd call stable or ready
for production BUT it's getting there. With this project I've
learned a considerable amount about creating a testing suite. I've
also had to do a number of redesigns because what I had made wasn't
quite as flexible as I later needed it to be.

I've got a number of plans for the future and some of them can be
seen on the Todo page, but there's one big one that isn't on there.
I am planning on writing a compiler for the Parrot VM and I'm
intending to have that as the canonical version of the language
once I've finished defining most of the features inside the Perl
modules.

I'd like to thank all of you that visit, (not counting spammers
that appears to be about 3 of you, maybe); and please register and
leave a comment if you're out there.
