I've just uploaded a new copy of
`Language::Farnsworth::Functions::GoogleTranslate` to cpan, this
update brings in a few more languages such as Yiddish,
HatianCreole, Welsh, Afrikaans and a few others that weren't
supported by the last release. Not a lot else to say about this
release, no bugs fixed (i'm not aware of any) and no new features
(I have some plans but haven't even come close to thinking about
how to make it work right). I've been mulling over an idea about
how to make what amounts to a set of paths for doing translations
with multiple services but haven't come up with a good idea on how
to design it all yet.
