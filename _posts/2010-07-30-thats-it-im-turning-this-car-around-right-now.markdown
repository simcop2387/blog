Ok, I've just pushed some changes to the git repo
([http://github.com/simcop2387/Farnsworth](http://github.com/simcop2387/Farnsworth "http://github.com/simcop2387/Farnsworth")
) that FINALLY adds code for doing `return[]` finally. I've also
added tests for it, since I'm sure I'm going to break it. This
marks a wonderful day for Farnsworth since it now allows you to
write code that isn't perfectly rigidly structured! I've got one
more error message to rewrite and to add the new function syntax so
that I can finally get other things I want in place (mostly
objects).
