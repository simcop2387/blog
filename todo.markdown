# Things to do before modules

-   Finish the rewrite of the output system
    -   Add ability to control precision of calculations
    -   Add significant digit support

-   Use the rewrites of the output system to create a graph of the
    interpreter state
-   Write something to serialize said graph into a
    freezable/thawable structure.

# Things to do After modules

-   Add proper Object Oriented stuff
    -   [Magic Value Library](http://simcop2387.info/todo/magic-values/ "Magic Value Library")
    -   IO Library
    -   Socket Library
    -   Graphing Library
        -   Two versions
            -   one that sends the graph off to a "server" to render them
            -   one that renders it in a blocking manner



-   Basic Mathematics
    -   Algebra functions
        -   Roots of polynomials
        -   Function/Lambda manipulation
            -   Inversions of single dependent variable functions
            -   Solving multivariable dependent functions for a single argument
            -   Compositing functions in a "permanent" manner (this one will be
                difficult for some functions)


    -   Calculus functions
        -   Derivatives
            -   Min-Max of functions
            -   Concavity tests

        -   Integrals
